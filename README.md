# Parametric-Monitor-Raiser
Parametric monitor raiser to fit your needs and raise your monitor enough to be on eye level and provide some extra space under it!

This project was a simple means of improving my Fusion/CAD skill and solving a big problem on my desk: space! This is to give me some more room and make some stuff on my desk and make it cleaner.

This is the design, with images:
